  <section id="eip-587"><title>The believer</title><para id="eip-764">The most basic role of them all is that of the common believer, the so–called "person in the pew". In a way, this is the one role we all play if we belong to any religion. Even if we graduate into a more important position, we never stop just simply being a member of our religion.
</para><para id="eip-205">Here are some terms that are used to describe the common believer in different religious traditions: layperson, lay member, adherent, congregant, devotee, disciple, parishioner, practitioner.</para><para id="eip-358">Although the terms in the above fact file are roughly equivalent, they are still not exactly the same. Use a good dictionary to find out the more exact meaning of each of these words. Also, some of these words tend to be used predominantly in one religion, or in one branch of a religion.</para></section><section id="eip-891"><title> Mediating figures</title><para id="eip-728">A very special function among religious people is that of the person who acts as an intermediary between the divine and the people. The most important role here is that of the <emphasis>prophet</emphasis>. A prophet is thought to receive direct communications from God, and can then communicate God's wishes to the people. Prophets are most commonly found in religions that emphasise God's role as creator and divine king.
</para><para id="eip-125">You have already encountered the names of a few prophets: Muhammad, of course, and Moses and Isaiah in Israel. But according to some, prophethood did not end long ago. The Baha'i Faith sees Baha'u'llah as the most recent prophet. In African Initiated Church circles, you may hear names such as Shembe and Lekganyane spoken of as modern–day prophets.</para><para id="eip-559">Another form of mediation is that of the <emphasis>priest</emphasis>. In this case the mediation is performed by means of ritual. In Catholicism, the mass is the central ritual by means of which God and people are reconciled, and this must be performed by an ordained priest. The priest is therefore the link between God and the common worshipper. Similarly, Hindu priests offer worship on behalf of the people and mediate between them and the gods.</para><para id="eip-467">In some religions, like Catholicism, priests must be <emphasis>celibate</emphasis>: they are not allowed to marry or to have sexual relations of any kind. In other cases, priests are expected to marry and produce the next generation of priests. This is the case, for instance, with the Hindu priests.</para><para id="eip-610"><title>Did you know?</title>In many of today's religions, priests can only be male. But in ancient times, many religions also had priestesses. However, in those institutions like the Anglican Church that have recently (since about 1980) allowed women to take on priestly roles, the ordained women prefer not to use that title, and just call themselves priests.</para></section>

<section id="eip-458"><title>Teachers and instructors</title><para id="eip-669">
In other religions, the individual believer is expected to approach the divine directly, without an intermediary. But it still has to be done correctly! This means that in those religions it is very important that the correct information is spread about the expected relationship to the divine. In these religions, the role of the religious <emphasis>teacher</emphasis> comes to the fore.
</para><para id="eip-437">In Protestant Christianity, this is the role of the <emphasis>pastor, preacher</emphasis> or <emphasis>minister</emphasis>. They deliver sermons in which they explain the meaning of scriptures and how scriptures can be applied to everyday life. In Hinduism the <emphasis>guru</emphasis> instructs people in the proper meaning of Hindu teachings, and in Tibetan Buddhism such a person is called a <emphasis>lama</emphasis>. In Islam this is the role of the <emphasis>imam</emphasis>, and in Judaism it is done by the <emphasis>rabbi</emphasis>.</para><para id="eip-823">Then there are people who also teach, but on a more academic level, and who are less directly involved with the practice of religion. In Hinduism such a person is called a <emphasis>pandit</emphasis>. In the western world we find the <emphasis>theologian</emphasis> and the <emphasis>scholar of religion</emphasis>. Theologians research one religion (their own) intensively, while scholars of religion study religious thought and activity more widely.</para><para id="eip-68"><title>Did you know?</title>Imams and rabbis also have another important task – apart from their teaching duties, they also have to interpret religious law. So they have to be both religious teachers and lawyers!</para></section><section id="eip-178"><title>Organisers</title><para id="eip-748">
Every religion needs people just to run the organisation efficiently. In many cases, this is taken on as an additional job by the priest, minister or pastor. In fact, many of these people surely wish that there was less administration and more time for their real jobs!
</para><para id="eip-838">But very often, there is simply too much work for one person to do. And in many religions, this leads to people who are not ordained (lay members) being drawn in to the running of the organisation. Different religious traditions may call them by different names, but we can collectively refer to them as <emphasis>elders</emphasis>.</para><para id="eip-518">Despite what the name suggests, you don't actually have to be very old to be an elder. But you should be widely respected for your sober lifestyle and your ability to work efficiently. Many elders are also successful people in their daily lives outside the religious organisation: they may be businesspeople, legislators or administrators (professors, not so much). In fact, most elders are not full–time religious professionals.</para><para id="eip-97">One religious organisation, a Christian church known as the Quakers, refuses to appoint any member to any role higher than that of elder. In other religious organisations, elders are formally placed below the minister or pastor, but in practice a strong–willed elder of long standing can have far more influence over the congregation than a young, inexperienced priest or minister!</para><para id="eip-808">In some religious organisations, you may also find a level of commitment greater than that of the elder, but not quite on the level of the ordained priest or minister. Again, let us borrow some Chriatian terminology and call such a person, in any religion a <emphasis>deacon</emphasis>. Deacons' status and responsibilities vary greatly from one religion (and one denomination) to another, but wherever we find them, they seem to be taking on the organiser's role.</para><para id="eip-158">I hope you realise that we have been painting with a very broad brush here. What one church calls a deacon may be called an elder in another. Some organisations will have a kind of ordination for the people they call "elders", but have laypeople serving on a  parish council that serve the same purpose. </para><para id="eip-842">The division into believers, mediators, teachers and organisers, however, seems to be fairly fundamental and we can find at least three of these four roles in all religions. Not all religions have mediating figures, but they all need to have the mass of common believers, somebody to keep reminding the believers what the religion is all about, and somebody who takes care that the lights in the group's meeting place stay on.</para><para id="eip-113">One last remark: in religious organisations that do not ordain women, the elder and deacon roles are often open to them, and many religious organisations would come to a complete halt if it were not for the organisational skills of their female members.</para></section>

Will the rule of priestly celibacy one day be regarded as something quaint that people did in the old days? Keep in mind that other rules once thought very important, like not eating meat on Fridays, have gone by the wayside.
