    <para id="import-auto-id1168798958931">There are scholars who study religion and culture who think that we are presently moving into a new era of development. They think that the modern era is being superseded by a "postâ€“modern" era where people are reacting against certain features of the modern era. These people see a new consciousness developing in which people are becoming more aware of the interconnectedness and interdependence of everyone and everything on earth and beyond. From this there flows a higher regard for nature and the environment and a new kind of spirituality.</para>
    <para id="import-auto-id1168800785264">Think back to what we said in chapter 3 on the status of religion in Europe. There we said that church buildings are being sold because people are not using them anymore, but simultaneously there seems to be a spiritual awakening among the youth as they join newer spiritual movements and go on pilgrimages and retreats all across the continent.</para>
    <para id="import-auto-id1168798002321">Many scholars also agree that the secularisation process that 30 years ago they thought would wipe out religion, did not materialise and that there are strong indications not only of <emphasis effect="bold">new religious movements</emphasis>, but also of reinterpretations of old traditions. In some quarters there is also strong reaction against these new movements in the form of <emphasis effect="bold">fundamentalism</emphasis> where people attempt to go back to the basics of their faith and in that way strengthen the religion</para>
