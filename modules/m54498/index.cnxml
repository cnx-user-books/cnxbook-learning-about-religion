  <para id="delete_me">Once we have established the facts, spotted correlations and made sure we understood things from the adherents' point of view, is there anything left to do? Yes, there is. We can now take a more critical view.
  </para><para id="eip-106">At this stage, you may be feeling confused. Did we not just tell you to respect the religious beliefs of adherents? Yes we did. But that was for a specific reason. If we do not make that effort, we are likely to accept or reject things based on purely emotional factors. Suppose you are researching a group that practices polygamy. One man. many wives. You may personally find the idea repugnant. But you still need to make the effort to understand that to these people, polygamy was commanded by God, and your feelings of disgust are not going to change their minds on the matter. You need to know what is going on in their heads before you can do anything with the data. Then you can critique that religion, calmly and without excessive emotion.</para><para id="eip-908">The critical approach, if we use the same example, goes something like this: "Let's suppose that polygamy was not, in fact commanded by God. Let's ask instead what social, psychological, historical or even physical factors could have caused this behaviour?" Critical scholarship emphasises theory over data. It tends towards functional rather than substantive understandings of religion, whereas phenomenology goes the opposite way.</para><para id="eip-85">But one would normally not just start off by criticizing religion randomly. You could do that, but your efforts would largely be wasted. It is more useful to critique religion from a specific existing theoretical perspective. This is like having a set of differently coloured sunglasses. If you wear the blue sunglasses, the whole world appears in shades of blue. If you take them off and put on a green-tinted pair of sunglasses, suddenly everything looks green! But the world did not change - only the way we looked at it. In the same way, if you use, for example, feminist theory to look at a problem, everything about that problem will look like it is gender-related, and there is nothing wrong with that. But now step out of that and use a theoretical lens that focuses on race, or class, and everything looks quite different. </para><para id="eip-653">Of course, every existing theoretical approach was created by somebody. It is possible to invent one's own theory of religion and use that as a lens to look at a phenomenon. We give out an award for that sort of thing: it's called a PhD in Religion Studies! Until then, let's look at some existing "lenses" one can use.</para><para id="eip-757"><title>Class</title>The first lens with which we can look at religion critically is also one of the oldest: social class. This approach is usually associated with Karl Marx, but he was by no means the first to note that social stratification was a major factor in society. Marx's negative view on religion was largely influenced by the work of the philosopher Feuerbach.</para><para id="eip-659">But you do not need to be a Marxist to recognise that there are different classes in society and that they react different to the message of religion. I once noted a pattern. It seemed that post-medieval Christianity and Buddhism were both able to spread into new territories, but they did so in different ways. Christianity spread from below, by mission work among the poorer classes of society. Buddhism invariably grabbed the middle classes first. Trying to explain this pattern got me my PhD. </para><para id="eip-588"><title>The mind</title>Another lens is psychology, the study of the mind. Sigmund Freud, one of the founders of this site, was famously dismissive of religion, which he regarded as a childish illusion. Other famous psychologists, including Freud's own student Carl Jung, were far more positive. There is even a branch called Transpersonal Psychology that attempts to blend psychological therapy with religious meditative practice. So there is not a single psychological approach to the study of religion.</para><para id="eip-356"><title>Gender</title>A gender theorist (which is subtly different from a feminist or womanist) looks at religion and asks how power relations between men and women has influenced, and been influenced by, the evolution of religious traditions. Within this broad field of studies, sub-fields of Women's Studies and Men's studies exist. More theoretically radical points of view within gender studies are called, in order of increasing radicality, feminism and womanism. A few points to understand: (1) "Male" is a gender too, and (2) you do not need to be a woman to agree with the feminist analysis that traditional religions have been part of the problem of a patriarchal system in which women's voices have been suppressed. <emphasis>All</emphasis> researchers need to understand that this is a valid theoretical lens with which to view religion, even if it is one you choose not to use yourself.</para><para id="eip-739"><title>Sexuality</title>The same applies to the theoretical approach that challenges our view that religious history existed entirely of heterosexual actors. This perspective, usually called Queer Studies, or, in a more technical application, Queer Theory, focuses on gay, lesbian intersex and other sexually unconventional categories that have been suppressed in the past and tries to restore them to their proper place in religious history. It differs from Gender Studies in one respect: while it is generally accepted that men can study gender issues, even call themselves feminists, Queer Studies tends to remain restricted to researchers who are themselves members of the communities in question. It remains to be seen whether history will repeat itself and we will see non-LGBT professors of Queer Studies. In any case. the very existence of this discipline calls our attention to the many blind spots we may have when we research a social phenomenon like religion.</para><para id="eip-591"><title>Biology</title>There are two ways in which biology has become relevant in Religion Studies. First of all, it is involved in the data collection method generally known as the Cognitive Approach to religion, which asks questions like "what are the brain activities associated with specific religious activities?" But it also figures in a critical sense, when researchers consider that, since religion has survived all this time and even thrived, there must be some evolutionary advantage to being religious. What could that be?</para><para id="eip-152"><title>History</title>One can also use the study of history as a lens through which to look at religion. This is by now an old methodology called Historical Criticism, or sometimes Higher Criticism. This one is a little unusual: many of the people who do this are in fact professional theologians in their respective religions! A good example of this was the Jesus Seminar in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. This is often portrayed in the media as a search for "the real, historical Jesus". In fact, Historical Criticism is usually concerned with the historical context of texts, rather than people. It is not a question of what Jesus really said, rather one of what people in the first century meant when they wrote down things they remembered, thought they remembered, or just plain imagined that Jesus said. When you have worked through all that, you may come to conclusions about the man himself, and these will always be couched in terms of historical probability.</para><para id="eip-785">There are many other critical lenses that can be used, and no doubt new ones are waiting to be developed.</para><para id="eip-539">One final aspect shared by many critical approaches is its <emphasis>activist</emphasis> nature. These approaches to studying religion (and everything else) do not merely wish to explain the world, they want to improve it. To analyse religion in terms of gender is to pave the way for a more equal role for women in the church. To investigate the way religions support or undermine class-based exploitation is to show which tendencies can be used to support a specific political platform. And so on. While phenomenologists of religion are happy to describe the religious world over and over again, critical scholars emphasise the important role played by religion in society, and how this can serve the interests of either the few or the many.</para><para id="eip-642">Does every scholar of religion have to do all of this? Not at all. There are academics who spend their entire professional lives carefully cataloging religious beliefs and practices. There are others who take the data discovered and use them as the raw material for their critical examinations of religion. Most of us do a bit of both. The constant interplay and tension between descriptive work and critical appraisal is one of the things that keeps this discipline lively and exciting.</para><para id="eip-947"><title>Postscript</title>Which comes first , observation or theory, the chicken or the egg? To theorise we need some data to serve as our raw material, but when we look at the world to find our data, we must already have some (thoretical) idea of what to look for!</para><para id="eip-1">There is no need to get caught up in this dilemma. Observation and theorising just happen. Whichever one starts the ball rolling, more observation of data will lead to more theory, and more theory will lead to more data, and so on indefinitely. This view of the research process is formally know as Grounded Theory. But whatever it is called, just keep in mind that we need both to do research into religion or anything else.</para></content>
